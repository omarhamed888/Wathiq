// ===================================================================================
// IMPORTANT NOTE: THIS WAS A MOCK API SERVICE.
// In a real-world application, you MUST create a secure backend (e.g., using Flask,
// Node.js, etc.) to handle these API calls. Your API keys should NEVER be exposed 
// on the client-side. This file simulated API responses.
// ===================================================================================

// This file is now empty as the mock services have been replaced by real implementations
// in `geminiService.ts`.
