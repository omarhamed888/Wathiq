## 🚀 About The Project
Wathiq AI is more than just a tool; it's a comprehensive digital safety companion. In an era of rampant misinformation and sophisticated digital threats, Wathiq provides users with a clear, trustworthy, and educational platform to verify the authenticity of digital content and learn how to stay protected. Our mission is to build digital confidence by making advanced AI-powered security tools accessible to everyone, regardless of technical expertise.

### ✨ Key Features
- **🤖 AI Media Scanner**: Perform forensic analysis on images and videos to detect signs of AI generation, manipulation, or deepfakes.
- **🔗 AI URL Safety Scanner**: Analyze URLs for phishing, malware, or scams using AI analysis grounded with real-time Google Search results.
- **📰 AI News Verification**: Combat misinformation by analyzing news headlines or articles for bias, propaganda, and factual inconsistencies.
- **🔑 Secure Password Checker**: Instantly check password strength with an offline analyzer (zxcvbn) that provides actionable feedback without sending your password over the network.
- **🎓 Gamified Learning Hub**: Embark on an interactive learning path with AI-generated lessons and quizzes tailored to different age groups (kids, teens, adults).
- **👤 User Progression System**: Track stats, earn points, level up, and view a history of your scans.
- **🌍 Multilingual & Themed**: Full support for English and Arabic (RTL), complete with light and dark modes for a personalized experience.

### 🛠️ Built With

* **[Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/)**: A beautiful and consistent icon set.

## 🏁 Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
- A **Google Gemini API Key**. You can get one from [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/tutorials/get_started_web).

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/wathiq-ai.git
cd wathiq-ai
```
2. **Install NPM packages:**
```bash
npm install
```
3. **Set up environment variables:**
   - Create a new file named `.env` in the project root.
   - Add your Google Gemini API key to the `.env` file:
```env
API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE
```
> **Security Note**: This project uses the API key on the client-side for demonstration purposes. In a production environment, you **must** proxy API calls through a secure backend to protect your key.
4. **Run the development server:**
```bash
npm start
```
The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000` (or the next available port).
